code for sensors

This code supplies a library needed to operate both the left and right sensor on the robot. each sensor is triggered at a specific voltage level and when that level is passed due to sensor proximity to a wall, either a green or red LED will light depending on which sensor was triggered. The final commit contains the complete code except for the right voltage levels because they keep changing due to batter charge levels. At the time of the commit, both worked.
